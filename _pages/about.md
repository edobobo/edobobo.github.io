## About

Hey there, I’m Edoardo.

I’m the co-founder of **Principled Intelligence** ([principled-intelligence.com](https://principled-intelligence.com)), a deep-tech company building principled, safe, and compliant AI systems. My work focuses on bringing large language models into real-world, high-stakes settings by combining strong modeling capabilities with governance, safety, and alignment by design.

Before moving into entrepreneurship, I was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering ([DIAG](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en)) at the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en), where I worked with the [Sapienza NLP group](https://nlp.uniroma1.it) led by Prof. [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli).

My research background is in lexical semantics—especially Entity Linking and Word Sense Disambiguation, but over time I shifted toward large-scale language modeling and applied NLP. I worked extensively on Large Language Models, including the **Minerva** project ([minerva-ai.org](https://minerva-ai.org)), one of the first families of LLMs trained from scratch on Italian data.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome in 2023, with a thesis titled _“Descriptive Modeling: Capturing Semantics in Neural Models via Natural Language Descriptions”_.

Outside of work, I love playing padel and videogames, and I’m a huge fan of *World of Warcraft*.
