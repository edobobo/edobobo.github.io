Hey there, I am Edoardo, a full-time researcher (RTDA) in the Department of Computer, Control and Management Engineering ([DIAG](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/en)) at the [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en).

I work with the [Sapienza NLP group](https://nlp.uniroma1.it) led by professor [Roberto Navigli](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/navigli), and I am interested in Lexical Semantics tasks such as Entity Linking and Word Sense Disambiguation, but I am also recently working on applications of descrptive modeling to Language Modeling, Semantic Role Labeling, and Machine Translation.

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome in 2023, with a thesis on "_Descriptive Modeling: Capturing Semantics in Neural Models via Natural Language Descriptions_".

I love to play padel and videogames, and I am huge fan of World of Warcraft.

I am a proud co-founder of [Sunglasses AI](https://sunglasses-ai.com/).
