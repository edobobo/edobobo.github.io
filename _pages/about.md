Hey there, I am Edoardo, a second year PhD student in the [Sapienza Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it/) led by prof. [Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/).

I am interested in Lexical semantics and my current research topics are Word Sense Disambiguation and Natural Language Generation.

If you want to contact me after the 9 p.m. you can find me in Azeroth.
