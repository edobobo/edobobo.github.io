Hey there, I am Edoardo, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Sapienza Natural Language Processing Group](http://nlp.uniroma1.it) led by prof. [Roberto Navigli](http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli).

I am interested in Lexical semantics and my current research topics are Word Sense Disambiguation and Natural Language Generation.

I completed my Master's degree in Engineering in Computer Science at Sapienza University of Rome, where I worked on Machine Learning applications for Biomedical science.

I love to play padel and videogames, and I am huge fan of World of Warcraft.

If you want to contact me after 9 p.m. you can find me in Azeroth.
